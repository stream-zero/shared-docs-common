			<p class="text-align-left lead">STREAMZERO is a product of GridMine GmbH based in Switzerland.</p>
			<p class="text-align-left lead">The team responsible for StreamZero has been engaged in the execution of Big Data initiatives since 2010, primarily within the realms of Fintech and Online Advertising.</p>
			<p class="text-align-left lead">In 2014, we launched GridMine as a services company for building Big Data Hubs</p>
			<p class="text-align-left lead">In 2017, an epiphany surfaced: the systems being constructed on top of Big Data frameworks were undergoing evolution with regard to data analytics, yet proved inadequate and unnecessarily intricate when constructing fully-fledged applications that harnessed the potential of big data. Moreover, the requirements of data platforms diverged significantly beyond mere Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) challenges.</p>

		<div class="col-lg-4 text-align-left">
			<p class="text-align-left lead">The initial iteration of StreamZero took shape as part of a larger project initiated in 2018.. By early 2022, through extensive engagement with Big Data projects, the platform had matured to the point where its distinctiveness in the market became evident. This realization prompted the decision to establish it as an independent entity, which materialized as StreamZero.</p>
			<p class="text-align-left lead">StreamZero's distinctive focus revolves around bridging the gap within the streaming data ecosystem, making the process of constructing and operating event-driven applications notably streamlined.</p>
