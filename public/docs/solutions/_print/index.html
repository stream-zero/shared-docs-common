<p>The solution</p>
<p>Balance Sheet Quality Control Model - different use case - for financial services -banks would have to identify the balance sheet quality for the corp clients - look on the balance sheet annually - analize and to give different risk ratings - use case automation of the risk assessment - skip the balance sheets that are very similar to previous years. If significant change - analyze manually - SEPARATE USE CASE - Notification Hierarchy! - depending on the event found in the balance sheet - different people need to be notified.</p>

<!-- 1 Summary -->
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>Implemented a fully automated data ingestion and orchestration system for the structural assessment of Corporate Client‘s balance sheets. Designed and implemented a two-level approach that includes both existing and publicly available information in a structured or semi-structured format. Extraction of relevant changes which are then compared to prior periods, explicit new data deliveries or internal policy baselines and thresholds.</p>
<!-- 2 Problem statement -->
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>Often banks are facing high staff turnover rate and general lack of advisory staff that is resulting in lack of client intelligence. Detailed client profiles either does not exist or outdated and does not reflect the latest situation. As a result it is hardly possible to increase the share of wallet of existing corporate clients.</p>
<!-- 3 Target markets -->
<h3 id="target-market--industries">Target market / Industries</h3>
<p>Target industry for this use-case is Financial Services – Banks, Insurances, Asset Management Firms</p>
<!-- 4 Solution description -->
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The solution is aimed to understand which corporate clients are able to gain a bigger share of wallet. Using the publicly available information, such as news and social media, the selling proposition for those clients is outlined. At the next stage the segmentation of those clients is performed to understand how much efforts need to be put to increase share of wallet and to shortlist most prominent of them.
This use case can be effectively combined with the Churn Analysis use-case.</p>

<p>Implemented the first service- and on-demand based big data and data science infrastructure for the bank. Data pipelines are built and maintained leveraging two key infrastructure components: a custom-built aggregation tool and the marketing content &amp; event platform. The aggregation tool builds the data lake for all analytics activities and enables the marketing platform to organically grow customer and campaign projects.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>Relationship Managers spend too much valuable time researching talking points and themes that fit their different client profiles. A simple product recommender usually cannot grasp the complexity of private banking relationships and hence the product recommendations are usually without impact.</p>

	<h2 id="churn-analysis-and-alerting">Churn Analysis and Alerting</h2>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>Screening your existing client population for signs of dissatisfaction and pending attrition can involve a broad range of analysis. Usually the focus is given to transaction pattern analysis. And while this may prove helpful it can be misleading in smaller banks with limited comparative data. We thus integrate a broader variety of less obvious indicators and include an advisor based reinforcement loop to train the models for a bank‘s specific churn footprint.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>When clients close their accounts or cancel their mandates, it usually does not come as a surprise to the Relationship Manager (RM). But for obvious reasons, the RM tries to work against the loss of a client with similar if not the same tools, processes and attitudes that have led to a client being dissatisfied. This is not to say that the RM manager is the sole reason for churn. But often clients do not or not sufficiently voice their issues and simply quit the relationship. To search, become aware and then listen for softer and indirect signs is at the heart of this use case.</p>
<h3 id="target-market--industries">Target market / Industries</h3>
<p>The described use case can be efficiently applied to any industry that is providing services to a large number of clients and has a large number of transactions.
Particularly following industries are benefiting most of this use-case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial services</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Using historical data, client communication and structured interviews with client advisors, we create a bank-specific churn ontology, that is then used to screen existing clients on an ongoing basis. Creating an interactive reinforcement loop with new churn-cases, this classification, predictor and indicator approach is ever more fine tuned to specific segments, desks and service categories. As direct and ongoing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) churn ratios and client satisfaction are measured alongside Assets under Management (AuM), profitability and trade volumes for the respective clients are classified as “endangered”.
Usually a gradual improvement can be monitored within 3-6 months from the start of the use case.</p>
<p>The solution included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial typical churn cause analysis based on historical data (client positions, and transactions)</li>
<li>Ideally inclusion of CRM notes and written advisor to client communication (prior to churn)</li>
<li>Sales &amp; Churn Ontology setup &amp; subsequent ontology matching</li>

<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>Multi-dimensional and ontology-based classification of products along different regulatory frameworks
and systematic mapping of the company&rsquo;s internal specialist expertise in a knowledge graph that can be used
by both humans and algorithms or other systems.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>Depending on the applicable regulation, the products and materials need to be classified for further usage.
This requires an effective classification approach and also involves the challenge of knowledge management.
Respective product / material information need to be extracted from various sources, cuch as core systems,
product information systems, etc. This task usually requires lots of time-consuming manual work utilizing the domain knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="target-market--industries">Target market / Industries</h3>
<p>The use case can be efficiently applied in the following industries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial services</li>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
<li>Retail</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The solution is based on analyzing the domain knowledge and converting it into ontology.
Domain knowledge is used as an input for the Machine Learning (ML) model: ontology-based annotator component
is analyzing the available data, be it text, unstructured or semi-structured data and feed it
into the ML model to perform the classification. The event-based workflow increases the efficiency and
stability of the classification process.</p>

<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>The handling of cross-jurisdictional accident resolutions involving more than one country was automated for a pan-European insurance group.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>The client was bound to a proprietary existing legacy core system which served all operational processes but did not lend itself to agile, digital use cases. Within the cross-jurisdictional context various third-party party core systems of partner network insurers also had to be integrated in the overall flow. In addition to already digital content, file-based and even handwritten forms of the European Accident Standard had to be taken into account. The growth of the customer did not allow for a continued manual processing.</p>
<h3 id="target-market--industries">Target market / Industries</h3>
<p>Focused on Industry segments, but easily configured to work for similar case management related processes that involve expert knowledge combined with extensive manual fact checking.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The customer wanted to automate and streamline the handling and ideally straight-through-processing of new cases whenever the context allowed for such an option and involve the correct stakeholders when a human resolution was called for. An existing data warehouse provided historic resolution data that could be used to train various Machine Learning (ML) models. In addition, a knowledge graph contained the expertise on how the company wanted to deal with certain constellations in the future.</p>
<p>The solution included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingestion of all relevant base data into a use case message bus</li>
<li>Automated plausibility check of the base claim (e.g. policy paid, client = driver, couterparty validity)</li>
<li>ML model to assess &ldquo;Fast Track&rdquo; options (depending on likely cost footprint)</li>
<li>Helper ML models to assess cost for vehicle, medical and legal cost</li>
<li>Curation model to extend &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; rules within knowledge graph</li>

	<h2 id="intraday-liquidity-management-optimization">Intraday Liquidity Management Optimization</h2>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>In order to avoid long internal lead times and to cater to stringent time-to-market expectations, an end-to-end Analytics Design and streaming real time analytics environment for group wide BCBS (Basel III) Intraday Liquidity Management was implemented. The bank&rsquo;s predictive liquidity and cash management models were rebuilt from scratch using real-time streams from 13 different SWIFT messaging gateways.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>All financial institutions need to be on top of their liquidity levels throughout the entire day. Since every organization usually experiencing many cash inflows and outflows during the day, it is diffcult to understand what are the currenct liquidity levels. To be compliant with the regulations, the liquidity levels need to be monitored. Having too much cash is not commerically viable and too little cash is too risky. Knowing the current cash levels the bank can adjust accordingly. The entire cash balancing act is based on the cascade of different events. Cash flow events and also cash-related events need to be integrated from various transaction management systems.</p>
<h3 id="target-market--industries">Target market / Industries</h3>
<p>The use case is applicable in all regualted and cash-intence industries, i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial service</li>
<li>Treasury departments of large corporations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>During the use case implementation 16 different cash-flow generating order systems were integrated using different schemas of how they handle transactions.
StreamZero Data Platform was able to resolve the complexities of the event handling to absorb all different situations and rules that need to be applied depending on the different states that the system can take.
Data sourcing patterns evolved quickly from single file batch to data streaming using Kafka and Flink. A global end-user enablement was achieved with a multi network environment for regional user and both logical and physical data segregation. Irreversible client data protection using SHA 256 hash algorithm allowed for globally integrated algorithms in spite of highly confidential raw input data.
We were able to implement dynamic throttling and acceleration of cash flows depending on current market situations and liquidity levels.</p>
<p>The solution included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptor agents to 16 cash-flow generating systems</li>
<li>Throttling and acceleration logic</li>
<li>Machine Learning (ML) models for liquidity projection</li>
<li>Harmonized event architecture</li>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>Many financial service providers struggle with the complexity and inefficiency of their client onboarding and recurring KYC monitoring practice. And many have issues, when it comes to Anti-Money Laundering (AML), source of funds and transaction monitoring compliance. The front-office staff often tries to cut corners and the compliance staff is overwhelmed with the number of cases and follow-ups that are required from them. Disintegrated and high-maintenance systems and processes are the usual status quo, with little budget and energy to change from due to the inherent risk.</p>
<h3 id="target-market--industries">Target market / Industries</h3>

	<h2 id="prospect-360">Prospect 360°</h2>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>For many strategic prospects the preparation of possible offers and establishment of a real relationship either involves great effort or lacks structure and focus. The Prospect 360° use case augments traditional advisor intelligence with automation to improve this original dilemma.</p>
<!-- 2 Problem statement -->
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>Hunting for new important clients usually is driven by referrals and the search for an “ideal event“ to introduce a product or service. Existing client relationships are usually screened manually and approached directly to request an introduction, prior to offering any services. Monitoring the market and a prospect’s connections can be cumbersome and is error prone – either introductions are awkward or they do not focus on a specific and urgent need. Hence the success and conversion rates seem hard to plan.</p>
<!-- 3 Target markets -->
<h3 id="target-market--industries">Target market / Industries</h3>
<p>This use case is traditionally applicable to such industries where the customer engagement and acquisition process is long and costs per customer are high:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Services</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>General Business Services</li>
</ul>
<!-- 4 Solution description -->
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>We introduce the idea of “soft onboarding”. Instead of selling hard to a new prospect, we start to engage them with tailored and relevant pieces of information or advice free of charge. We do, however, tempt this prospect to embrace little initial pieces of an onboarding-like process, extending the period we are allowed to profile the needs and preferences of the client and the related social graph. Turning a prospect into an interested party and then increasing the levels of engagement of the period of up to six months allows for a more natural and client-driven advisory experience, that is shifting from a “product push” towards a “client pull”.</p>
<p>The solution included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of disparate news &amp; event information sources (licensed &amp; public origins)</li>
<li>Provisioning of select RM &amp; client data points to understand social graphs</li>
<li>Word parsing of text-based inputs (e.g. news articles and liquidity event streams)</li>
<li>Onboarding &amp; Sales Ontology matching</li>
<li>Identification of possible liquidity events, new referral paths &amp; sales topics of interest</li>
<li>Aggregation of findings, reporting, notifications and organizational routing</li>
<li>Ideally inclusion of reinforcement learning (via RM, client &amp; assistant feedback loops)</li>

<p>Leveraging all existing data sources from core banking, risk- and trading systems to the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and general ledger as granular input for your regulatory Single Source of Truth (SSoT).</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>Most regulatory solutions today require huge maintenance effort on both business and technology teams. Ever more granular and ever more near-time regulatory requirements further increase this pressure. Usually the various regulatory domains have created and continue to create silos for central bank, credit risk, liquidity, Anti-Money Laundering (ALM) / Know Your Customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring regulations. Further requirements from ePrivacy, Product Suitability and Sustainability regulations even further dilute these efforts.</p>

<p>Leveraging the semantic integration capabilities of StreamZero Data Platform, it  allows you to reuse all the integration efforts you have previously started and yet converge on a common path towards an integrated (regulatory) enterprise view. The ability to eliminate high-maintenance Extraction Transformation Loading (ETL) coding or ETL tooling in favor of a transparent and business driven process will save you money during the initial implementation and during ongoing maintenance.
Templates and a proven process were applied to use what exists and build what’s missing without long-term lock in.</p>
<p>The solution included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic Integration leveraging all your prior integration investments</li>
<li>Business driven data standardization and data quality improvements</li>
<li>No Code implementation =&gt; business analysis is sufficient to generate the integration layer</li>

<h3 id="target-market--industries">Target market / Industries</h3>
<p>The use case can be applied for the following solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intelligent packaging</li>
<li>Intelligent logistics</li>
<li>Industrial applications – Industry 4.0</li>
<li>Consumer and luxury goods</li>
<li>Home protection</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>A small-size energy-autonomous intelligent cells (microelectronic parts) are integrated into any object / package to enable remain in contact to it, identify it electronically, provide a location and sense temperature, pressure, movement, light, and more. They are intelligent, able to make basic decisions and save small information pieces.
The cells communicate bidirectionally with the software through global IoT networks of our partners selecting the best energy-efficient technologies available where they are and building a neuronal backbone of objects in constant communication.
Bidirectional capabilities allow transmitting data of the sensors and receiving instructions and updates remotely.
Cells can also interact with the electronics of the objects they are attached to, they can read and transmit any parameters and providing remote control of them wherever they are.
All data of the cells are transmitted to our own cloud applications, a learning brain using the power of data management and AI of Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure where we can combine IoT data of objects with any other data in intelligent and self-learning algorithms.
The location or any other parameter of the objects can be displayed in any Browser or Smart device.
The user interfaces can be customized and  allow to interact at any moment changing frequency of connection, SMS or email alarm values and who receives them (human or machine) or acting as remote control of any object.
All of this can be offered fully pay peruse, to ensure a very low entry point for the technology. You can turn the cell on and off remotely, and only pay cents per day when you use the cell capabilities or buy the solution.</p>

	<h2 id="voice-based-trade-compliance">Voice-based Trade Compliance</h2>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>Convert the voice-based advisor to client phone conversations into text. Analyze for possible breaches of regulatory and compliance policies. This multi-step analytical process involves voice-to-text transcription, a compliance ontology, text parsing &amp; natural language understanding.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>Many if not most client advisors to client communications still occur via phone. These conversations happen in a black box environment that is difficult to track and audit. Potential compliance breaches in areas such as insider trading or conflict of interest can only be identified and intercepted at great cost while only listening in on select phone calls. The vast majority of conversation remains unchecked, leaving the organization in the dark and at risk. Often compliance is at odds with sales – one controlling the business, the other pushing the boundaries of acceptable risk.</p>
<h3 id="target-market--industries">Target market / Industries</h3>
<p>Described use case can be efficiently applied in the industries where the track / audit of the voice-based communication is required.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Leveraging your existing Public Branch eXchange (PBX) phone recording infrastructure &amp; partnering with your choice of voice-to-text transcription service, the solution is to automatically screen every conversion. The transcribed text files are parsed against the Sales &amp; Compliance Ontology. Using Natural Language Understanding (NLU) the use case identifies which call advice and trade decisions occurred and high-lights possible compliance breaches.</p>
<p>Once the predictions become more accurate a sales focused “topics-of-interest“ screening can be added.</p>
<p>The solution included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voice to text transcription</li>
<li>Word parsing of text-based inputs</li>
<li>Compliance &amp; Sales Ontology matching</li>
<li>Identification of possible compliance breaches (and / or sales topics of interest)</li>
<li>Aggregation of findings, reporting, alerting</li>
<li>Action recommendation</li>
</ul>
